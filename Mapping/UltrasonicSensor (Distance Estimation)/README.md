HC-SR04 is a commonly used for non-contact object detector and distance mesurement.
This sensor uses sonar system to detect the location of an object. An ultrasound wave is generated by high plse in trigger pin and echo pin will estimate the time for wave to travel from the sensor util reach the object and comeback to the sensor. An illustrastion bellow shows how the sensor work and the estimated calculation for the distance by using 10 microsecond pulse.
