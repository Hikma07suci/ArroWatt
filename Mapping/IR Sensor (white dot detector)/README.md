IR sensor works with light transmitter and receiver. As we understand, there are several coulour that can reflect light perfectly and poorly. IR sensor uses this atribute as an advantage to detect and object and 2 signifiant different colour (such as white and black). on this project, IR sensor is used to detect the white dot on the surface of the fence to estimate the right position of TR to throw the arrow.
